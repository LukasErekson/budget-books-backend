# [ISSUE TITLE]

### Issue Type: (Feature 📘 | Bug 🐛)

## Description

- Write a short, "executive-summary" type description that gets the general idea across. Ideally, this would be a great candidate for the blurb in the release notes or a commit message.

## Technical Details / Discussion 🧠

- Write any ideas here about the implementation or challenges. This is a space for anything from brainstorming notes to pseudo code. The general idea is to flesh this out in a more technically-specific way.

## Unit Testing Required 📋️

- Give some user scenarios, preferably in the BDD "Given... When... Then..." format so that the end-user experience is concretely thought through and tested.
